## **Notes:**

- **Direct Expenses vs. Operating Expenses:**  
  Direct Expenses (e.g., Cost of Goods Sold) are kept separate as they directly relate to production. Operating Expenses include all other costs incurred to run the business.

- **Customization:**  
  This Chart of Accounts is a starting point. You may adjust, add, or remove accounts based on your industry or specific business requirements.

- **Integration:**  
  Preloading these accounts into your accounting system provides a standardized structure for accurate financial reporting and ease in generating financial reports (Balance Sheet, Income Statement, etc.).
